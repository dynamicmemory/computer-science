Unit Overview:

Cryptography is the study of secret writing that allows for messages to be converted to cyphertexts intelligible only to the intended recipients in possession of cryptographic keys. Cryptographic techniques are vital in modern cybersecurity to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation, and to protect data in storage and transit.

In this unit you will gain an understanding of the principles and practice of cryptography, starting with number and information theoretic concepts, and classical ciphers. You will learn about contemporary symmetric and public-key cryptosystems for encryption, authentication and digital signatures, as well as techniques for key management.




Learning outcomes
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

demonstrate knowledge and understanding of number and information theories and apply them to analyse ciphers;

understand the principles behind classical ciphers and use software tools to break them;

demonstrate in-depth knowledge and advanced understanding of modern cryptosystems, and be able to analyse and evaluate them; and

design and/or implement a cryptosystem and conduct experiments to empirically compare it to a state-of-the-art system.
