# COSC110 - ASSIGNMENT 2
This program is a solution for our loyal customer "Codetown burger Co". They have once again returned to us with
a problem they would like solved. This time they would like to implement a graphical user interface for their customers
to view the menu at any of their in store locations.

## How to launch
Start the program by running: 
```
'python3 menu.py'
```

How to use
- By simply running the command above you will launch the Graphical user interface.
- The interface will automatically scroll for you between all the burger options and 
display the contents of each burger
- If you would like to look at a particular burger you can click any of the names of the burger which are located 
under the logo.
- Each option will stay on screen for 5 seconds before changing to the next one 

Thats all there is to it, a very simple implementation of the customers request, below is a sample screenshot
of the program in action.
