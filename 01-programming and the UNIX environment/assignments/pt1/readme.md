# COSC110 - ASSIGNMENT 1

This is a light weight, easy to use program built for the good people at 
Codetown burger co. This system was build for the express purpose of taking
a customers order and outputing the price. This is to be implemented for 
use at the register or at their self-serve booths in-store.

## How to launch
Start the program by running: 
```
'python3 burger.py'
```

##How to use
- First enter the number of burgers you would like to order
- Note that you can only order between 1 and 10 burgers, any input outside
- These parameters will result in the program asking to try again.

Once you have selected how many burgers you want, you'll be prompted to 
choose the following items for your burger one after another:
- Which bun 
- Which Sauce
- Amount of patties
- Amount of cheese
- What Salad

The correct input for all these options is displayed in after the '-' in the
question itself, note that the inputs are not case-sensitive so no need to
worry about capitalisation and all wrong options will result in being prompted 
again for your choice.

Once you have finished with building your burger(s), you will be
informed of the total cost and the program will exit.
