Unit Overview:

A programming language gives us a way of modelling and expressing a computer program. As programs tackle more complex tasks using big, fast, and distributed flows of data, the need for more powerful ways to think about and express our programs will only increase.

This unit introduces you to the paradigms (the particular styles or features) behind advanced programming languages used by many of the world’s leading software companies.

Taught predominantly using Scala, a mixed-paradigm language that will familiarise you with many concepts, the unit helps you to develop knowledge and technical skills with broad practical applications.

You will learn about functional programming, different type systems, and techniques for asynchronous, streaming and reactive programming. These techniques are useful across a wide spectrum – from making small problems simple, to modern event-based web systems, to “fast data” systems that process large flows of asynchronous data.





Learning outcomes
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

analyse how programming languages relate to models of reasoning about a computer program;

write programs in a modern functional programming language;

build systems that use abstractions for asynchronous programming and reactive streams;

understand and apply advanced language features and type systems in the design of programs; and

understand the use of functional programming in practice.
