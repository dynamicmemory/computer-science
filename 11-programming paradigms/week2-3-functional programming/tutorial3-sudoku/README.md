## Sudoku Sensei

This is a little tutorial exercise in higher order functions, for students learning Scala.

First, have a go at the exercises in `StepOne`.
These are the same exercises as in the first tutorial, but now you know higher order functions like map and flatMap,
they should be much more straightforward to complete.
Except maybe the Roman numerals one!

Then have a go at completing the Sudoku Sensei exercises. These lead you through writing a little program
that will take a Sudoku grid, and identify any squares where there is only one possible number that could go there.
It doesn't use any kind of lookahead -- it won't solve the whole grid -- but just exercises higher order functions such
as `filter`, `map`, and `exists`.
