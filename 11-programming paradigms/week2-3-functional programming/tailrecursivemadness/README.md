# Tail recursive madness

Ok, not so mad yet, but this might start to accrue a few more examples!

This tutorial exercise is provided as a scala-cli project.

I recommend you open the source code in an editor and run

```sh
scala-cli test . --watch
```

This will re-run the test suite every time you save the source file.

The instructions are in the src, and the goal is to make the tests pass.
