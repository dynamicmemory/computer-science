# Assignment One

This assignment contains six challenges. You should complete all six challenges.

Each challenge will ask you to implement a number of functions. Where you see '???' you need to supply the implementation of the function.
Sometimes, this will require you to write other functions (as local functions inside the one you are implementing).

A suite of unit tests is provided to assist you with seeing whether your functions are working. You may not remove any tests or test cases. 
(A diff will show this up!)

You can execute the tests with

```sh
scala-cli test .
```

or

```sh
scala test .
```

depending on how you have Scala(-CLI) instsalled

To test only a single challenge, say Challenge1

```sh
scala-cli test . --test-only '*.Challenge1Suite'
```

or 

```sh
scala test . --test-only '*.Challenge1Suite'
```
