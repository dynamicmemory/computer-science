## Riddle week

This week, we've got some puzzles to learn the syntax we've come across so far.

One riddle does use Scala 3 extension methods, to show you what they're like, but otherwise it should mostly be things you've seen.

There are two coding files:

* Riddlers.scala contains some puzzles based on fivethirtyeight.com's The Riddler column - a column with new puzzles each week that
  often turn out to be viable to write a little bit of code to solve. (It's really more of a maths column, but many of the puzzles
  turn out to be amenable to simulation.)

* Practice.scala contains some common questions that turn up as coding exam questions fairly often in lots of places.

This time, *there are no unit tests written for you*. You are free to write some yourself, or you can just model the puzzles in code
and print out the answers from the main methods.
