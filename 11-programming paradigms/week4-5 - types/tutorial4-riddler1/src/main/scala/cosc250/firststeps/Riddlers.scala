/**
  * This is a puzzle based on a "Riddler" from fivethirtyeight.com
  * 
  * For some square numbers, if we remove the last digit we get another square number.
  * For instance, 256 is 16 * 16, but if we remove the last digit we get 25 (which is 5 * 5)
  * Let's call these numbers "extra perfect squares" 
  * 
  * Write a function that will return all the "extra perfect squares" between 10 and some value max 
  * 
  * Hint: to find if a Double is a whole number, you can check if d % 1 == 0
  * Hint: to knock off the last digit, just divide by 10. Int / Int has type Int 
  *     - that is if you divide an Int by an Int it will throw away any remainder
  * Hint: Math.sqrt(i:Int):Double will give you a number's positive square root

  * A word worth its weight in letters... Another puzzle based on a fivethirtyeight riddler
  * 
  * Let's suppose we assign the letters A to Z the values 1 to 26
  * 
  * Then, let's suppose we add up the values of the letters in words. So, ONE has the value 15 + 14 + 5 = 34
  * and TWO has the value 20 + 23 + 15 = 58.
  * 
  * We'll write longer words without the "AND". So, 1,417 would be ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN, with value
  * 379 and 3,140,275 would be THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE, with value 718.
  * 
  * Write code to find the largest whole number that is less than its value in letters.

  /**
   * Another Riddler! 
   * 
   * Suppose we have a Tower of Hanoi set.
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi
   * 
   * There are three pegs, from left to right. There are 3 discs, increasing in size, all of which start on the first peg.
   * On any given turn, the player can move the topmost disc from one peg and place it on another peg, so long
   * as it would not put it on a smaller disc.
   * 
   * In this puzzle, we're not going to try for the minimum number of moves. Instead, we're going to say that
   * the the player *always makes a random legal move*. Your job is to measure, over 100 runs, what the average
   * number of moves is before the Tower is solved (before all the discs are in order on the last peg).
   * 
   * For this riddle, I've defined some extension methods for you to complete.
   * 
   * This lets you say things like state.isValid(move) and state.move(move), even though State is just a Seq[Seq[]]
