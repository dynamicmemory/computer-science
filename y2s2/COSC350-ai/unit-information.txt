Unit Information:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving branch of Computer Science that deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in machines. From the fields of speech recognition, to machine translation and robotics, AI has contributed to state-of-the art technology and is a key focus for future research and development.

This unit introduces you to a range of foundational areas in AI. The unit will help you to develop AI problem solving skills with broad applications to computational problems.

Topics include intelligent agents, classical and heuristic search strategies, evolutionary algorithms, probability and Bayesian inference, and basic machine learning concepts.

With a series of engaging practicals and programming assignments you will be ready to demonstrate technical capabilities that can help you to stand out in your career.



Learning outcomes
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

explain the history and foundations of artificial intelligence;

analyse problem specifications and derive appropriate solutions for them;

map solutions to selected artificial intelligence algorithms; and

design and implement solutions in a high-level programming language.
