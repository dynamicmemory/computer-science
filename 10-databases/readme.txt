Unit Information:

The widespread application of digital information systems in society today produces vast amounts of data. Appropriate management of this data is essential for it to be an effective tool for decision making and value adding.

Introducing you to the concepts of database design, this unit takes you from the conceptual level through to the physical level of database management systems, developing your understanding of the techniques underpinning these systems.

You will study relational databases and learn how to model, create and efficiently query them using Structured Query Language (SQL), using relational algebra to provide more generalised data and query definitions within relational database systems.

Design strategies to avoid redundancy, concepts of functional dependency, normalisation and relational decomposition are examined.

Exploring approaches for connecting external applications to databases, you will also gain an awareness of security issues involved with data access.



Learning outcomes
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

describe the essential components of database management systems (DBMS) and apply data modelling approaches to design databases for real-world scenarios;

explain the principles of the relational model, implement databases using a relational DBMS and understand the architectures that allow application software to use data stored within a database schema;

work with data stored in a relational DBMS by applying SQL to create database tables, extract, present and modify data, and implement integrity that reflect business logic;

understand and apply the principles of normalisation and functional dependencies to assess and optimise a relational schema;

explain the concepts of transaction management, query processing, physical storage and database indexing; and

explain the societal issues around information privacy, as they relate to the storage and dissemination of data, and apply views and permissions to implement security constraints.
