# COSC102-assignment-2
Assignment 2 for COSC102

A quick summary of the brief

Your task is to apply a machine learning algorithm to create a classifier that predicts the Site of the plant based upon 2 out of the 17 features within the dataset and assess the performance of your classifier. To achieve this task you will need to implement the following steps:

- Load the dataset and partition the dataset in the train and test sets.
- Select the 2 most higher-performing features based upon cross-validation carried out on the training dataset.
- Construct a confusion matrix based on the classifiers performance on the test set and use this to calculate the recall, precision and F1 scores for each class.
- Construct a ROC curve for each class and calculate the respective AUC values
- Construct a suitable visualisation that demonstrates the decision boundaries learned by the classifier on the features selected through the cross validation process. Your visualisation should also plot the testing data points across your decision regions.
