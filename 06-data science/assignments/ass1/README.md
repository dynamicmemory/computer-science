# COSC102-assignment-1

Assignment 1 for my datascience class, below are the two briefs, I will upload a png of the task sheet if i remember too...

## Question 1 - Predator-Prey Population Dynamics (50 Marks)
In nature, the populations of predators and prey species are often strongly linked. As the population of the predators increases, the population of prey decreases (due to increased predation). Likewise, as the population of prey decreases, the population of the predators decreases (due to scarcity of prey).


## Question 2 - Climate Data Analysis and Visualization (50 Marks)
Climate change is a significant global issue, and analyzing historical climate data can provide insights into trends and patterns. In this question, you will analyze a dataset containing historical temperature and precipitation records. You will perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
