Week 3 Probability

Addition rule for disjoint events:

male = 60 / 100
gay = 18 / 100
male & gay = 11 / 100

Therefore the probability of a male or gay is:
P(A or B) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a & b)
          = (60 + 18 - 11) / 100
          = 67 / 100
          = 0.67 or 67%

Multiplication for independent events:

For the probability of female AND gay:

female = 40 / 100
gay = 18 / 100

P(A & B) = 40/100 * 18/100 
         = 0.072 or 7.2%
