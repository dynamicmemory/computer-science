Explanatory Variables - The name we give a variable when we think it may affect
another variable.

Response variables - The response or outcome of a test or event.

Probability

Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes
Two outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they both cannot
happen.

Addition rule of disjoint outcomes:
If A1 and A2 are two disjoint outcomes then we just add them together.
example:
Rolling a 1 or a 2 on a dice =
1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

For any two events where the outcomes are disjoint or not we have a general rule
we can apply:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
So rolling a 1 or 2 (which is disjoint, but still works) is:
1/6 + 1/6 - 0/6 (as we cannot roll both a 1 and 2 so the prob is 0) = 1/3

Picking a diamond or a face card from a regular deck of cards
13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52 = 22/52 = 11/26

Rules for probability distributions:
1. The outcomes listed must be disjoint.
2. Each probability must be between 0 and 1.
3. The probabilities must total 1.

The complement of an event is essentially the opposite or whatever is left over
or not in event A. A and it's complement Ac are mathmatically related:

P(A) + P(Ac) = 1 or P(A) = 1 - P(Ac)

For independent events, i.e two different die both rolling a 1
P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) 
This is different to before where it was one die rolling a 1 two times.

###### CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY ######
If a probability is based on a single variable, it is a marginal probability.
The probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a
joint probability.

The conditional probability of outcome A given condition B is computed as the
following:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Previously I wrote a formula for general multiplication for indepedent events,
we can generalize the rule for events that might not be independent.
If A and B represent two outcomes or events, then
P(A and B) = P(A|B) x P(B)

It is useful to think of A and as the outcome of interest and B as the
condition.

- Formula for all of the calculations and explanations as to what happens to the results if each parameter is manipulated.
I.e more observations, independence, larger variance.
