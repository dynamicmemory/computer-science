# Question 1 - Is there a difference in javelin performance between athletes 
# participating in the Decathlon and the Heptathlon. 

# Exploratory analysis
boxplot(javelin~sport, ylab="Javelin Score (meters)", xlab="Sport", 
        col=c("lightblue", "brown"))

# Decathlon median javelin scores are much higher then heptathlon median scores
# Interquartile ranges do not overlap at all, visually Decathlon score are much
# higher. One thing to note is the single outlier that may be a problem when 
# observing our data for normality.

# Test choice
# We will use a two way t-test to compare the means of the athletes in each 
# event to test for a significant difference between the two.

# Hypothesis
# ho: - The mean javelin score for one sport will be no different from the mean
#       javelin score for another sport. avg1 = avg2 (add mu symbols and subscripts)

# ha: - The mean javelin scores for each sport will be difference from one
#        another. avg1 != avg2

# Test Conditions
# Independence - Every athlete is an individual and independent bean
# Normal distribution - We will test this with a qqplot

sports <- factor(sport)

qqnorm(javelin, col=sports)
qqline(javelin, col = "black")
# although most of our points land on the qq line, the tails do not and they get 
# further away from the line the further they move away frmo the center of the 
# data, this creates somewhat of an S bend in our data. Because of this we will
# run a sharpio test to see what it thinks about the distribution of our data

shapiro.test(javelin)
# So we got a pvalue of 0.000049, which is far below the threshold 0.05 which 
# determines if our data is normal or not, because of this and the qqplot, it
# it safe to say that our data does not have a normal distribution, nevertheless
# we will continue with the question for the assignments sake and administer a 
# two sampled t-test.

decathlon <- subset(data, sport=="Decathlon")
heptathlon <- subset(data, sport=="Heptathlon")

hist(decathlon$javelin)
hist(heptathlon$javelin)
# Ok so both distributions actually look fairly normal so i may have made a 
# mistake along the way, tomorrow we will see where that may have been!



# The test
t.test(javelin~sport)
