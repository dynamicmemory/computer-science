# Chapter 6 - Inference for categorical Data

# Success- failure condition (again)

n = 826
pbar = 0.7

n*pbar > 10
n*(1-pbar) > 10

# With both conditions being true we can continue using the 
# normal distribution to model pbar since we don't know the 
# true value of p

# Find the se of pbar

se = (pbar * (1 - pbar) / n)**0.5

# Constuct a 95% conf interval

# qnorm will find zstar when we are working with normal distro
zstar = qnorm(0.975) 
# we want 95% conf int, so we get 0.975 i.e 0.025 each side

pbar_upper = pbar + zstar * se
pbar_lower = pbar + zstar * se

# Confindence interval for a single proportion

# 1 - Prepare, identify pbar and n
# 2 - Check, Verify conditions for pbar being nearly normal, 
#     for one proportion conf int use pbar over p to check 
#     success-failure conditions
# 3 - Calculate, If conds hold, compute se using pbar and find
#     zstar using qnorm() and conf int percentage, remember for
#     for 95% that we want 5% so thats 2.5% each side.
# 4 - Conclude, interpret the conf int in context of the problem

# Hypothesis testing for proportions

# h0 - p = 0.5, borrows would evenly support for and against
# ha - p != 0.5, majority borrowers would support or oppose

# with pbar = 0.51, successfailure conditions still hodl so i say
# yes, they do support

pbar = 0.51
se = (pbar * (1 - pbar) / n)**0.5

zscore = (pbar - 0.5) / se 

zscore = 0.59 # Rounding error throwing off my calc, so hard coded
# to be same value as textbook to make sure i was doing things right

# To get p value we use pnorm() with the zscore calc'd, but i think..
# We do 1 minus pnorm() to get the lower tail only (which is one side)
# Then we multiply it by 2 to have it on both sides since we want to 
# know if we are above 0.5 or below as oer our alt hypothesis.
pvalue = (1 - pnorm(zscore)) * 2

# Since our pvalue is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null
# hypothesis and we can say there is not convincing evidence to prove
# that a majority of the payday loan borrowers support or oppose
# the new regulations.

# Choosing a sample size to estimate a proportion

# if you goal is to find the amount of participants needed to end
# up with a conf int less than 0.04 using a 95% conf int
# then all you need to do is solve

zstar * (pbar (1 - pbar) / n)**0.5 < 0.04

# seems complicated but it's not, we need pbar and n. N is what we
# are trying to find so we solve for it

n = zstar**2 * pbar *(1 - pbar) / 0.04**2 

zstar = qnorm(0.95)

first_model = zstar**2 * 0.017 * (1 - 0.017) / 0.01**2
second_model = zstar**2 * 0.062 * (1 - 0.062) / 0.01**2
third_model = zstar**2 * 0.013 * (1 - 0.013) / 0.01**2


# payday loan final question

1.96**2 * 0.7*(1-0.7) / 0.05**2
