#a

treatment_no_pain = 10
treatment_pain = 33

control_no_pain = 2
control_pain = 44

treatment_pain_free = treatment_no_pain / (treatment_no_pain + treatment_pain)
treatment_pain_free * 100

#b 

control_pain_free = control_no_pain / (control_no_pain + control_pain)
control_pain_free * 100

#c

# The treatment group had a larger perecent of patience becoming pain free
# after 24 hours.

#d

# Complete chance could be another explanation for the results from the 
# experiment

If there is a relationship between two variables then it is said that those
variables are associated or dependant variables, otherwise they are independant
variables.

# EXERCISE 1.3

#a

# Do air pollutants effect rates of preterm births

#b 

# 143196 participants, babies born between 1989 to 1993

#c

# carbon monoxide - continous
# nitrogen dioxide - continous
# ozone - continous
# preterm birth - categorical


# EXERCISE 1.5

#a

# Does explicilty telling children not to cheat have any effect or not.

#b 

# 160 children range from age and sex

#c

# age - numerical discrete
# sex - categorical
# only child or not - categorical
# outcome - categorical

# EXERCISE 1.13

#a

#Woman giving birth to babs, most specific the babs themselves
# the smaple was the babs more than 100k of em

#b

# Observational study and no this cant be used to establish a relationship or 
# infere on a population

# EXERCISE 1.15

#a

# 600 asthma patients

#b

# They could be generalised and they could be used to show a causality relationship

# EXERCISE 1.17

#a

# An American in the sample - an observation
# Number of hours spent relaxing - variable
# 1.65 - sample statistic
# Average number of hours all mericans relax - population parameter


# EXERCISE 1.19

#a

# Observational

#b 

# multi-stage

# EXERCISE 1.21

#a

# as the percentage of internet users goes uo in a country, the life expectancy
# increases.

#b
# obdertvatoinal

#c

# Higher percentage of internet usage is related with how advanced a country is
# so one would expect that the higher the internet use, the higher the health
# care system and living standards in general.
