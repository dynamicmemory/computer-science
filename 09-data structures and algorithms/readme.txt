Unit Information:

In a data driven world, your ability to keep pace with new trends in software development relies on a sound understanding of the fundamental data structures used in programming.

Emphasising both algorithm design and efficiency analysis, in this unit you will explore practical data structure implementations using object-oriented programming in C++.

Data structure implementations include linked lists, binary search trees, hash tables, stacks and queues, heaps and expression trees. Recursion and efficient sorting algorithms are also covered.

Extend your capacity to use a structured approach to find solutions for the complex challenges you may encounter in a range of programming scenarios, and hone invaluable technical and analytical skills.



Learning outcomes:
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

write, compile, and run programs in C++;

perform complexity analysis in order to determine the efficiency of a given algorithm;

implement key details of each of the data structures presented in this unit; and

determine which data structure should be used for the efficient solution of a range of different problems, and understand why this is the case in each instance.
