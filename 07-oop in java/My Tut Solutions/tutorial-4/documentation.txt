Brief run down of requirements
1. Create an app for a pet adoption service
2. Dogs are the main pet they adopt out
3. Users need to be able to search the services db for dogs that meet their querying
4. Criteria should include
  - breed
  - age
  - sex
  - desexed status

5. If a dog exists in the db that matches the users query then show them that dog
6. A user can then choose if they want to adopt a dog from the matching results
7. If they do they must supply name, email, phone number and that info must be saved
